# Group App Tailwind and React Challenge

## Challenge

In this group exercise, you’ll use React and Material Tailwind to build a unique application as a team! Material Tailwind is a popular UI library with pre-built React components, enabling you to rapidly create visually appealing user interfaces. Your challenge is to brainstorm an app idea, plan and divide the tasks, and implement the app together within a short timeframe.

This exercise focuses on teamwork, effective communication, and the ability to quickly build a functional, responsive application in React. You’ll present your finished application at the end of the session.

## Key Learnings

- Collaboration and communication within a team
- Using GitHub for version control and code collaboration
- Leveraging pre-built components from a React UI library (Material Tailwind)
- Building responsive, functional UIs in React
- Integrating third-party APIs or libraries in React applications

## Project Requirements

As a team, brainstorm an idea for a small application, design it, and bring it to life with the starter application provided. Your app must meet **at least one** of the following criteria:

1. **Use a Third-Party API**: Fetch and display data from an external API, like the GitHub API or any other publicly available API.
2. **Integrate an Additional Library**: Incorporate a third-party library beyond Material Tailwind (e.g., a charting library, date picker, or map library).
3. **Responsive Design**: Ensure your application is fully responsive for various screen sizes.
4. **Use React Context**: Implement React Context to manage and share state across components.

## Team Structure

- **Team Size**: 3 members
- **Time Limit**: 3 hours
- **Presentation**: Present your completed application to the group at the end of the session.

## Acceptance Criteria

- **Idea and Planning**: As a team, brainstorm and agree on a simple application idea. Quickly outline its core functionality and decide on the division of labor.
- **GitHub Collaboration**: Set up a GitHub repository to collaboratively work on the project. Ensure each team member creates branches, commits changes, and follows best practices for pull requests.
- **Implementation**: Build the application using the provided starter project with Material Tailwind.
- **Feature Requirements**: Ensure your application fulfills **at least one** of the following requirements:
  - Uses a third-party API
  - Integrates an additional third-party library
  - Is fully responsive
  - Uses React Context for global state management
- **Presentation**: Demonstrate your application’s functionality and explain each member’s contributions.

### Additional Criteria (Stretch Goals)

- **Deployment**: If time allows, deploy the application on a platform like Vercel or Netlify for easy sharing and access.
- **Extra Feature**: Add an extra feature to make the app more interactive or functional.
- **Documentation**: Add a `README` with setup instructions, a summary of the app’s functionality, and acknowledgments for any libraries or APIs used.

## Instructions

1. **Set Up and Plan**: As a team, discuss ideas and choose a simple application concept. Outline the core features, define each member’s role, and estimate time for each task.
2. **Project Setup**: Install the starter project and set up a GitHub repository for collaborative work.
3. **Implementation**:
   - Quickly scaffold the application using Material Tailwind components.
   - Implement at least one of the feature requirements (API integration, third-party library, responsive design, or React Context).
   - Test the application to ensure functionality and responsiveness.
4. **Stay on Schedule**: Track your progress as a team, adjust tasks as needed, and ensure everyone is on the same page with project updates.
5. **Prepare to Present**: Be ready to showcase your app’s features and discuss each member’s contributions to the project.
6. **Stretch Goals (Optional)**:
   - Deploy the application for easy access.
   - Add an extra feature to enhance the app.
   - Write a README with documentation on setup, functionality, and any tools used.
